        Ensure a good experience for ARES-6 error reporting
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171699

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo and Jon Davis.

        This patch fixes a bug where we would silently fail running ARES-6. The bug
        was that we were calling reportError with the wrong |this| value.
        I also cleaned up a bit of the code around error reporting. We
        now indicate which test failed, and update the status to reflect
        that a failure happened.
        
        This patch also modifies the CSS a bit to work better on smaller
        screened devices. The CSS prevents the status from having a line
        break both when an error is reported and when we're running the 
        benchmark.
